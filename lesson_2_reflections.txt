What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize the git repository, it converts a normal directory to a git repository, which now can be version-controlled. It creates a .git folder with all the metadata required. Although, init command doesn't track the files yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is there on my local machine from where I pick up files that I want to track and put it in the staging area. It allows me to have flexibility and control over what files (if not all) I want to track using version control. It is acrually quite a cool concept.
